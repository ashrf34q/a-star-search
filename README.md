# a-star-search

This is a JavaScript implementation of the A* search through a maze. The maze consists of a grid of cells of any dimensions, in here we're using an 12x11 grid.

The purpose of the algorithm is to find the most optimal path from a starting position to a goal position in the maze. The maze contains some blocked cells which we cannot traverse.
